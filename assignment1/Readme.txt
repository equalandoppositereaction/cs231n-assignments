Note: 
  I couldn't get the autorefresh to work so I had to refresh the ipynb after every change in the python files.
  The wandb api key in one of the ipynb is no longer valid so dont waste your time trynna be funny .

Assignment 1

Setup: https://youtu.be/DsGd2e9JNH4?si=_2AC3UtzRJinqfpP

Goals
  Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier
  Q2: Implement a Softmax classifier
  Q3: Two-Layer Neural Network
  Q4: Higher Level Representations: Image Features
  Q5: Training a fully connected network

Note. Ensure you are periodically saving your notebook (File -> Save) so that you don’t lose your progress if you step away from the assignment and the Colab VM disconnects.

Goals:
  In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier.

  The goals of this assignment are as follows:
    Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages).
    Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
    Develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy.
    Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier.
    Implement and apply a Softmax classifier.
    Implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier.
    Implement and apply a fully connected network classifier.
    Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers.
    Get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations as opposed to raw pixels, e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features, etc.

Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier
  The notebook knn.ipynb will walk you through implementing the kNN classifier.

Q2: Implement a Softmax classifier
  The notebook softmax.ipynb will walk you through implementing the Softmax classifier.

Q3: Two-Layer Neural Network
  The notebook two_layer_net.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.

Q4: Higher Level Representations: Image Features
  The notebook features.ipynb will examine the improvements gained by using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.

Q5: Training a fully connected network
  The notebook FullyConnectedNets.ipynb will walk you through implementing the fully connected network.
